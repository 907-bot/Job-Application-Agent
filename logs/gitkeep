# This file ensures the logs/ directory is tracked by git
# .gitkeep files are used to track empty directories in git repositories

# Directory structure:
# logs/
# ├── .gitkeep           (this file - keeps directory in git)
# ├── app.log            (application logs - NOT tracked)
# ├── error.log          (error logs - NOT tracked)
# └── access.log         (access logs - NOT tracked)

# Usage:
# - Application logs go here: logs/app.log
# - Error logs: logs/error.log
# - Access logs: logs/access.log
# - All *.log files should be in .gitignore
# - Only .gitkeep is tracked to preserve directory structure

# Logging configuration:
# - See config/logging.yaml for detailed logging setup
# - Logs rotate based on size and time
# - Maximum file size: 10MB per file
# - Backup count: 10 files
# - Log level: Configurable via environment variables
