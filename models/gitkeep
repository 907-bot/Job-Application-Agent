# This file ensures the models/ directory is tracked by git
# .gitkeep files are used to track empty directories in git repositories
# since git doesn't track empty directories by default

# Directory structure:
# models/
# ├── .gitkeep                  (this file - keeps directory in git)
# ├── checkpoints/              (model checkpoints during training)
# ├── pretrained/               (pre-trained model weights)
# └── saved_models/             (final trained models)

# Usage:
# - Checkpoints are saved during training: python scripts/train_model.py
# - Models are loaded during inference from this directory
# - Add *.pt files to .gitignore to avoid committing large model files
