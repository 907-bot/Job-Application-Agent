# This file ensures the data/ directory is tracked by git
# .gitkeep files are used to track empty directories in git repositories

# Directory structure:
# data/
# ├── .gitkeep                  (this file - keeps directory in git)
# ├── sample_jobs.json          (8 sample job postings)
# └── sample_resume.json        (sample resume for testing)

# Data files included:
# 1. sample_jobs.json - 8 real job postings with full details
# 2. sample_resume.json - Detailed sample resume for Alex Chen

# Usage:
# - Used by scraper.py for testing and demonstration
# - Used by customizer.py for resume samples
# - Used by tests for mock data
# - Do NOT commit real user data to git (add to .gitignore if needed)

# To add more sample data:
# 1. Create JSON files in this directory
# 2. Name them descriptively: sample_*.json
# 3. Follow the same structure as sample_jobs.json and sample_resume.json
# 4. Add to git: git add data/*.json
